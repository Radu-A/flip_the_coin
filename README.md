## Overview

### What I learned

The project has been developed in vanilla javascript, so no framework were used. The goal was to practise the DOM management. I would highlight three main challenges:

- Use transitions to rotate and hide one image and rotate and show another image.
- The management of randomness.
- The proper use of "setTimeOut".

### Useful resources

- [MDN - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions) - A great guide to learn how to use transitoins on CSS.
- [MDN - setTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout) - All the necesary information to use this method.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

## Features

The main challenge is to show a coin that you can flip:
- If you click on the coin, this will flip and show her other side.
- If you click on the button, the coin will flip a random number of times.

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
